# Decentralized Calculator DApp

## Project Description

The Decentralized Calculator DApp is a blockchain-based application built on Ethereum that provides basic arithmetic and scientific calculation functions with persistent history tracking. This smart contract allows users to perform calculations on-chain, with each user maintaining their own private calculation history stored permanently on the blockchain.

The contract implements essential mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power of 2, square root approximation, and absolute value functions. All calculations are recorded with timestamps and can be retrieved by users at any time.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a transparent, immutable, and decentralized calculation platform that demonstrates how everyday utilities can be transformed into trustless blockchain applications. This project serves as a foundation for more complex mathematical and financial calculation systems in the decentralized ecosystem.

We aim to:
- Provide a reliable, censorship-resistant calculation service
- Demonstrate practical smart contract development patterns
- Create a foundation for future decentralized mathematical tools
- Enable transparent and verifiable calculation history for auditing purposes
